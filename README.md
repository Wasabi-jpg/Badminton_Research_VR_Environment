# Improving Badminton Shots VR Research
## Introduction:
Hi, this project was for my STEM Research in Osaka, where I studied the effects of Unity 3D's Time library on badminton player performance in VR! I focused on the concept of slowing down user's perception of time within my VR environment to see if their performance would improve.

## Current Updates:
This is only the scripts I used for the project. It doesn't contain the Unity world templates I used or other things of the sort.
